You're given an HTML file with three nested divs, each with a unique ID.

Using only CSS, style the HTML to have the appearance of six concentric colored circles.

From outside to inside, the circles should have the following characteristics:

<ul>
    <li>300px by 300px, #ff0000</li>
    <li>250px by 250px, #ffa500</li>
    <li>200px by 200px, #ffff00</li>
    <li>150px by 150px, #008000</li>
    <li>100px by 100px, #0000ff</li>
    <li>50px by 50px, #800080</li>
</ul>
